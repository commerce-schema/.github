## Welcome to Commerce Schema!

**Commerce Schema** is a community and collection of shared specifications for working with eCommerce data, including 1st-party eCommerce “events” (like add_to_cart or purchase events) and data warehouse entities like orders, products, and customers. With these shared specifications (really, a shared point of view), we can collectively start building open source, composable analytics solutions for eCommerce.
